		<h1>Proposal for UI Improvements to The Colonist Web-game</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>This proposal is submitted by Group 6, comprising Adil Ghoghawala, Gustaf Shumlansky, Khiem Do, and Michael Johanson. We aim to address specific usability issues identified in the user interface of The Colonist, an online adaptation of the popular board game. Our findings are based on a combination of direct user observations, interviews, and feedback from various gaming forums.</p>
			
			<h2>Problem Statement and Research Methods</h2>
			<p>
				The current interface of The Colonist, while vibrant and visually engaging, suffers from a lack of
				distinct visual demarcation between different sections. This results in a confusing user
				experience as important elements such as 'Play Online' buttons compete visually with less
				critical elements. Users have reported challenges with navigation due to unclear labeling and
				the absence of intuitive cues that guide user interactions. Additionally, the user account area
				and text density within certain sections of the site are minimalistic and underwhelming, which
				could deter new or less tech-savvy users.
			</p>
			<p>
				To address these issues, we conducted a comprehensive usability audit. We pre-screened
				users to assess their familiarity with both the physical and digital versions of the game. Our
				protocol involved observing users as they navigated the site to perform a series of tasks such as
				creating an account, starting a game, altering their profile, and playing around with custom
				lobbies. The time taken to complete these tasks was recorded to identify any difficulties faced by
				the users.
			</p>

			<h2>Summary of Usability Audit Results</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Users often hesitate when navigating between game modes due to the uniform color scheme.</li>
				<li>The rules section was frequently overlooked as it was placed in the bottom of the page and also opened in a new tab.</li>
				<li>The website did not match thematically with the board game it was modeled after and seemed “kiddie”.</li>
				<li>Users were initially confused when they first loaded into a game due to a mass amount of similar data being shown at once.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Discussion and Proposed Changes</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Improved Information Hierarchy and Visual Distinction:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Color Scheme Adjustments:</strong> Implement a more diversified color palette that differentiates between interactive elements (such as buttons and links) and static information. This change will reduce visual competition among elements and make navigation more intuitive. We also choose colors that fit thematically with the original game Settlers of Catan and that were a bit more dull.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Redesigned Navigation and Interface Elements:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Language Selection Icon:</strong> Introduce a prominent icon for language selection to improve visibility and access, ensuring that players from different linguistic backgrounds can easily switch languages. We also added an icon to make it easier to spot.</li>
						<li><strong>Vision Impaired Toggle:</strong> Added a button to toggle the colors of the site for users with visual impairments. We realize that there are a lot of colors on the site and for some users this might be distracting. Thus we decided to add a symbol to toggle the site’s colors making it easier to view. It tries to use colors sparingly and goes for high contrast colors.</li>
						<li><strong>Better Grouping for Game Elements:</strong> When in a game all the surrounding boxes of information were all the same colors which overwhelmed first time users. Hence we added colors to the gameplay actions to draw the user’s attention to these boxes first and then made the boxes with additional information in a duller, more standoffish box. This way once users got comfortable with the important gameplay elements they would start to notice these other bits of information.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Streamlined User Experience:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Unified Design Language:</strong> Our proposed design shifts to a mature, less child-like aesthetic that aligns with the theme of a strategy board game like Settlers of Catan. This involves using deeper, more subdued color tones and wood textures reminiscent of the physical game’s design.</li>
						<li><strong>Accessible Rules and Game Directions:</strong> The rules and game instructions will be directly accessible within the gaming interface, with an improved layout that labels essential sections clearly, such as game directions, chat, and game resources. This approach prevents the need to switch tabs or windows, keeping the players engaged and informed within the game environment.</li>
						<li><strong>Simplify Homepage Navigation:</strong> The page labeled “Home” takes the user to a different page than the homepage or the page when the site is loaded/ the page that can be accessed by clicking the logo. “Home” should be changed to “Play Game.” However, there is a play game button on the homepage. Since that button gives the user limited game play options change it to “Quick Play.”</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Enhanced Functional Accessibility:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Clarified Text Labels and Buttons:</strong> Text labels and call-to-action buttons will be redesigned for better clarity and visibility. This includes larger fonts for critical actions like 'Create room' and 'Play vs Bots', which are essential for new users navigating the site for the first time.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				These proposed changes are aimed at creating a more intuitive and user-friendly interface,
				which will encourage longer engagement times and increase user satisfaction. By making these
				improvements, The Colonist can better serve its growing user base and potentially attract new
				players who are seeking an enjoyable and easy-to-navigate online gaming experience. It will
				also serve to better connect with its targeted demographic and less toward young children.
